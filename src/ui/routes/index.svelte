  <h1>Membership management for Hash&nbsp;House&nbsp;Harrier kennels</h1>
  <ul class="list u-m-top-6">
    <li><strong>Attendance:</strong> Check in hashers to events, with the app or a printable roster.</li>
    <li><strong>Reports:</strong> Get summaries of individual events or yearly totals.</li>
    <li><strong>Offline first:</strong> The app works in your desktop and mobile browser. It works offline, so if there is no network connectivity, you have no limits.</li>
    <li><strong>You manage your own data:</strong> There is no global database. Your data is independent from everyone else's. Easily set up free servers to host your data in a few minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Free:</strong> OnCheckIn is free to use, but we recommend donating to us, if you find this software helpful. Contact us if you'd like to suggest or sponsor certain features.</li>
